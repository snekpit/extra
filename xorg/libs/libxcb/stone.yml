summary     : C interface to the X Window System protocol, which replaces the traditional Xlib interface.
description : |
    libxcb provides an interface to the X Window System protocol, which
    replaces the traditional Xlib interface. It has several advantages over
    Xlib, including:

    - size: small, simple library, and lower memory footprint
    - latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
    - direct protocol access: interface and protocol correspond exactly
    - proven thread support: transparently access XCB from multiple threads
      easy extension implementation: interfaces auto-generated from XML-XCB

    Xlib also uses XCB as a transport layer, allowing software to make
    requests and receive responses with both, which eases porting to XCB.
    However, client programs, libraries, and toolkits will gain the most
    benefit from a native XCB port.
